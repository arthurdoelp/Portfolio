The problem is that there is no clear method to identify popularity metrics, measure these metrics in an accurate way and subsequently use these metrics to predict new song performance. With the help of unsupervised (K-Means) and supervised (Linear Regression) machine learning algorithms, I intend to develop a solution that would provide insight and statistical analysis in a non-technical format for people to understand the potential performance of new songs.",
